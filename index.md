## Why use a build-out sourcing specialist

Too often, commercial tenants fail to accurately factor build-out costs into their overall budget plan. 

### In fact, over 80% of commercial build-outs run at least 20% over budget. That isn't tenable for small to medium businesses - and often sets them up for failure before opening their doors.

Even with the best of intentions, tenants fall prey to a number of factors:
- **Landlord disengagement** following initial lease signing
- **Architects introducing complexity** while attempting to design original spaces
- **Contractors who are generalists** rightfully focused on getting the job done, vs. sourcing the most cost effective materials
- **Tenant inexperience** in the build-out process, leading to costly decisions and surprises down the road

**Hiring a build-out sourcing specialist means locking build-out material costs in, at a fraction the retail prices paid later in the process.

## Why use Scout Provisions

### Scout Provisions was born out of experience - its management team has overseen over 300 commercial build-outs in the greater South of the US, representing over $1,000,000 spent on build-out materials. 

After supporting dozens of tenants struggling with higher-than-expected build-out costs, Scout was formed to help tenants anticipate and control these costs early in the build-out process. 

Scout's planning process features three distinct, crucial benefits in the build-out process:

**1. Cost control and savings for tenants**

**2. Streamlined architectural designs**

**3. Greater focus and speed for contractors**

## How does Scout Provisions work

Scout Provisions focuses on core build-out materials, which most often represent the bulk of tenant spend yet often have little to do with the "final mile" aesthetic decisions a tenant must make. We want our customers to build-out the business of their dreams -- freeing time and energy to focus on the little things, by helping them quickly control the big, standard things.
